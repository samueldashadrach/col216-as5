testcases explanation

t1

use lw jump and loop

t2

even more jumping, beq, bne

t3

see whether longer programs are given priority

t4

see if priority is given to program with another lw

t5

see if priority is given to program with dependent variable

t6

another lw with dependent variable versus another lw without

t7

see if priority is given to program that tries to access different rows or same rows

t8

both programs are infinite loops
